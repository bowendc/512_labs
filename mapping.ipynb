While other GIS software can do more, the functionality in R is fairly robust for most policy use-cases. Further, it has the advantages of being free and working easily with the other types of data and models with which you are familiar. \n",

The first time you install these packages, you might need to install some dependencies on your system. Be prepared for it to take a few minutes.  "
